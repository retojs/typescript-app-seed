    Hello stranger!
Stranger:
    Hi.
Expert:
    Let me introduce you to ComicVM!
Stranger:
    Ok.
    What does ComicVM mean anyway?
Expert:
    VM stands for "Virtual Machine".
    Wikipedia can tell you all about it.
Stranger:
    Sure.
    So what good is this Comic virtual machine?
    What can you do with it?

Expert:
    ComicVM is a tool to tell a plot in the form of "Comics".
    Comics is a medium used to express ideas through images, often combined with text or other visual information.
Stranger:
    I know, that's what it says on Wikipedia...
Expert:
    Right.
    So what you feed into the ComicVM is a plot
    in the form of a screenplay script
    and a little bit of layout configuration
    in the form of a yaml file.
(to the 4th wall)
    If you have never heard of yaml let me google it for you.
Expert:
    Based on these two files
    and some images for characters and backgrounds
    ComicVM will render your plot as a visual novel or: Comic.
    Just like the one we are in right now.
Stranger:
    Neat.

Expert:
    The main goal in the design of ComicVM has been to keep the necessary configuration minimal.
    The layout yaml file for this whole Introduction e.g. is just {{ n }} lines long.
Stranger:
    Nice. I like that.
Expert:
    If you choose a generic layout out of the box
    you don't even have to manually configure anything at all.
    The layout algorithms inside ComicVM can put any plot into a well readable Comic.
Stranger:
    Interesting.
    So how do these algorithms work?
Expert:
(smiles)
    I'm glad you're asking.
    Let's go to the next scene to learn more!
Stranger to Expert:
    Yay!
