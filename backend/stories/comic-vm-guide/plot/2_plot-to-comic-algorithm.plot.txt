    So you wanted to know how ComicVM puts a plot into Comics.
Stranger:
    Yup.
Expert:
    First of all the plot is parsed into a series of plot items.

Show the plot items next to this comic.

    A plot item is equivalent to a sentence in natural language:
    It specifies who (subject) does (verb) what how to whom etc. (objects, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, you name it.)

    Secondly your layout yaml defines how to place panels on pages
    and how many plot items should be illustrated in each panel.

    Let's write a sample plot and the layout yaml for it together.

Stranger:
    Yay!

Expert:
    A plot always starts with a title,
    a list of characters
    and it specifies where the scene takes place.

// TODO make clear that a plot is always for one scene

    The layout yaml file
    defines panels in strips in pages like this:

Expert:
    As always ComicVM takes the simplest approach:
    Put all characters involved in the plot items next to each other into the panel.
Stranger:
    That's it?
Expert:
    It all starts from that,
    but we need a few more things of course.

    Plot items describing dialog simply specify what someone says.
    ComicVM puts all this dialog into speech bubbles pointing to the speaker.
    All other action described in the plot items has to be illustrated with images.
    So we need images for characters and background.


    The background image we specify for each panel.
